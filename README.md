# pwnable.kr-exploits
Some exploit for the ctf pwnable.kr written in python3 with pwntools

You need this repo:
https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools

###
IF YOU HAVE PWNTOOLS ON PYTHON2 THIS SCRIPT WORKS FINE BUT YOU SHOULD DELETE SOMETHING, THIS WHY IN PYTHON3 U CANNOT CONCATENATE STR() WITH BYTES()
###

P.S.:IF SOMETIMES IT MAKES AN ERROR IT'S BECAUSE WHEN U INSTALLED WITH pip3 install pwntools U DIDN'T ADD TO /PATH ALL OF THE PWNTOOLS SCRIPT, BUT ANYWAYS IT WILL SHOW ALWAYS THE FLAG
